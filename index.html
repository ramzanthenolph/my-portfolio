        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi. Here is something about me. I am 23 years of age, born and raised in Nairobi.</p>
        <p>Ever since I was a little boy I was always facinated by computers. I wanted to know more about them and how to create computer programs. So I decided to take up programming classes to achieve my long lived dream.</p>
        <p>It is only fair I tell you more about myself, hobbies and interests. Apart from coding I also have interests in motion picture production and interior designing. Thats why I have always wanted to take part in the production of a movie and also create my own interior design company.</p>

        <p>My hobbies include: swimming, gaming, fast cars and movies.</p>
